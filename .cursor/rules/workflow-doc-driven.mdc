# Document-Driven Workflow

Before coding, read these files in order:
- `docs/plan.md`
- `docs/context.md`
- `docs/checklist.md`

## Mandatory Workflow

1. Restate the current task in one or two sentences.
2. Propose a short implementation plan aligned with `docs/plan.md`.
3. Implement in small steps and report changed files clearly.
4. Update documents before final response:
   - `docs/plan.md`: status and next step
   - `docs/context.md`: key decisions and reasons
   - `docs/checklist.md`: checked and unchecked items
5. If any checklist item is skipped, explain why.

## Quality Gate

- Run or describe relevant verification after edits.
- Explicitly mention risks, assumptions, and follow-up work.
- Avoid changing direction silently; record scope changes in `docs/context.md`.
